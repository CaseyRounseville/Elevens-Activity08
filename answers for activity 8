In elevens, three cards can be removed if they are a king, queen, and a jack.     Elevens uses a 9 card board. Tens uses a 13 card board. Thirteens uses a 10 card board. In thirteens, kings are removed alone.   In tens, kings, queens, jacks, and tens are removed four at a time when they are the same rank(remove all 4 siuts of a card in   one turn). It is more likely to win thirteens than it is to win tens.
